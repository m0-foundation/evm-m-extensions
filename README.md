## $M Extensions Framework

**M Extension Framework** is a modular templates of ERC-20 **stablecoin extensions** that wrap the yield-bearing `$M` token into non-rebasing variants for improved composability within DeFi. Each extension manages yield distribution differently and integrates with a central **SwapFacility** contract that acts as the exclusive entry point for wrapping and unwrapping.

All contracts are deployed behind transparent upgradeable proxies (by default).

---

### 🧩 M Extensions

Each extension inherits from the abstract `MExtension` base contract, which defines shared wrapping logic. Only the `SwapFacility` is authorized to call `wrap()` and `unwrap()`. Yield is accrued based on the locked `$M` balance within each extension and minted via dedicated yield claim functions.

#### In-Scope Extensions

- **`MYieldToOne`**

  - All yield goes to a single configurable `yieldRecipient`
  - Includes a blacklist enforced on all user actions
  - Handles loss of `$M` earner status gracefully

- **`MEarnerManager`**

  - Redistributes yield to all holders minus per-address `feeRate`
  - Enforces a whitelist; non-whitelisted users are frozen and yield is redirected as fee
  - Yield is claimed via `claimFor(address)`
  - **Does not handle loss of `$M` earner status**, leading to potential insolvency if not upgraded

- **`MYieldFee`**

  - All users receive the same yield rate, discounted by a global `feeRate`
  - Yield can be redirected via `claimRecipient` per user
  - Includes `updateIndex()` to resync with new `$M` rates
  - Can handle loss and regain of `$M` earning status via `disableEarning()` and `enableEarning()`

- **`MSpokeYieldFee`**
  - Optimized for EVM sidechains (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism)
  - Index updates occur via bridging, not time-based growth
  - Uses an external `rateOracle` for fee calculation
  - Inherits most behavior from `MYieldFee`

### 🔁 SwapFacility

The `SwapFacility` contract acts as the **exclusive router** for all wrapping and swapping operations involving `$M` and its extensions.

#### Key Functions

- `swap()` – Switch between extensions by unwrapping and re-wrapping
- `swapInM()`, `swapInMWithPermit()` – Accept `$M` and wrap into the selected extension
- `swapOutM()` – Unwrap to `$M` (restricted to whitelisted addresses only)

> All actions are subject to the rules defined by each extension (e.g., blacklists, whitelists)

### 💱 UniswapV3SwapAdapter

A helper contract that enables token swaps via Uniswap V3.

- Immutable and admin-controlled
- Uses Uniswap's `SwapRouter02`
- Functions:
  - `swapIn(path, ...)`
  - `swapOut(path, ...)`
- Supports multi-hop paths or single-hop with default 0.01% fee
- Token whitelist is controlled via `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`

# Overview

Guardian Audits conducted an in-depth security review of M-extensions by M^0 labs from June 23th to June 27rd, 2025. The comprehensive evaluation included developing a specialized fuzzing suite to uncover complex logical errors across various protocol states. This suite was created during the review period and successfully delivered upon the audit's completion.

# Contents

This fuzzing suite was developed for M^0 and updated with remediations at July 20th. The suite primarily targets core functionality found in `MEarnerManager.sol` and `MYieldFee.sol`, `MYieldToOne.sol` and `SwapFacility.sol`.

This suite implements a minimalistic, instant-on approach to fuzzing. It employs Echidna's stateful fuzzing mechanism to simulate the project lifecycle and and minimizes mocking with M0 token, MinterGateway, wrapped M token and Uniswap V3 local deployments.

All tested properties can be found below in this README.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

`npm i`

`forge install`

## Usage

2. Run Echidna fuzzing with Foundry compilation tool

`forge clean && forge build test/fuzzing/Fuzz.sol && ./echidna . --contract Fuzz --config echidna.yaml`

3. Run Foundry reproducers
   `forge test --mt test_coverage_mint`
